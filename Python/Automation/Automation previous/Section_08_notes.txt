Section 07: More About Strings

Class 01:
Strings are enclosed by a pair of single quotes or double quotes (as long as the same kind are used).
Escape characters let you put quotes and other characters that are hard to type inside strings.
Raw strings (which have the r prefix before the first quote) will literally print any backslashes in the string and ignore escape characters.
Multiline strings begin and end with three quotes, and can span multiple lines.
Indexes, slices, and the "in" and "not in" operators all work with strings.

Class 02:
upper() and lower() return an uppercase or lowercase string.
isupper(), islower(), isalpha(), isalnum(), isdecimal(), isspace(), istitle() returns True or False if the string is that uppercase, lowercase, alphabetical letters, and so on.
startswith() and endswith() also return bools.
‘,'.join([‘cat', ‘dog']) returns a string that combines the strings in the given list.
‘Hello world'.split() returns a list of strings split from the string it's called on.
rjust() ,ljust(), center() returns a string padded with spaces.
strip(), rstrip(), lstrip() returns a string with whitespace stripped off the sides.
replace() will replace all occurrences of the first string argument with the second string argument.
