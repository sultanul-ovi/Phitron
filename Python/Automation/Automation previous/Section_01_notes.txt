Section 01: Python Basics

Class 01:
Explain what you are trying to do, not just what you did.
If you get an error message, specify the point at which the error happens. (Including the line number.)
Copy and paste the entire error message and your code to a pastebin site like pastebin.com or gist.github.com.
Explain what you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem.
List the version of Python you’re using.

Class 02: 
An instruction that evaluates to a single value is an expression. An instruction that doesn't is a statement.
IDLE is an editor.
The interactive shell window has the >>> prompt.
The file editor window is where you enter code for complete programs.
Data types: int, float, string
Strings hold text and begin and end with quotes: ‘Hello world!'
Values can be stored in variables: spam = 42
Variables can be used anywhere values can be used in expressions: spam + 1

Class 03:
Type programs into the file editor (not in the interactive shell window with the >>> prompt)
The execution starts at the top and moves down.
Comments begin with a # character and are ignored by Python; they are notes & reminders for the programmer.
Functions are like mini-programs in your program.
The print() function displays the value passed to it.
The input() function lets users type in a value.
The len() function takes a string value and returns an integer value of the string's length.
The int(), str(), and float() functions can be used to convert values' data type.
