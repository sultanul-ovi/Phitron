No program can be perfect. That's why new versions of every software are released continuously. The current version (1.0) of our program needs to be improved as well.

Currently, when the user inputs a proper noun, such as Delhi or Paris, the program will 1) convert that string into lowercase and 2) it will look for the lowercase version (i.e., delhi or paris ) in the dataset. However, the dataset doesn't have delhi or paris. It only has Delhi and Paris. Therefore, no definition is currently returned for proper nouns such as Delhi or Paris.

Please try to fix this issue. You can think of adding another conditional block. You can find the code we currently have attached in this lecture for your convenience.

A student discovered another issue with the program. The program cannot return the definition of acronyms such as USA or NATO; therefore, add another conditional to make the program return the definition of such words.
